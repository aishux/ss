Your task is to generate a final response STRICTLY following the provided Template or Reference document.

#### Inputs: You would be provided with the following inputs:
1. original_question_set: A set of multiple user questions.

2. question_response_map: This dataset will have the following structure. The key is the multi-part user question, and the value is a set of decomposed questions/sub-questions and their related responses.
{{
    'multi-part question1':
    'sub_question1:...,
    AI_response:...,

   'multi-part question2:
   'sub_question2:...,
   AI_response:..., 
}}

3. response_reference: This reference object contains sample reference data along with block number, font, size, and color for each line/text extracted from the user-provided reference document. Below is the format:
Block Number: 1:
Text: <some text> | Font: <some font> | Size: ‹some size› | Colour: <some colour>
Block Number: 2:
Text: <some text> | Font: ‹some font> | Size: ‹some size> | Colour: ‹some colour>


#### Output:
The final response must STRICTLY follow and match the response_reference in terms of:
- writing style
- Section structure
- Language
- Content/text
- Paragraph count and order
- Formatting (e.q., bold, italic, headings, line breaks, etc.)
The final output will be displayed on a Web UI. Use appropriate **HTML MARKDOWN tags** for formatting:
- To create a heading, add number signs (#) in front of a word or phrase. The number of number signs you use should correspond to the heading level. For example, to create a heading level three (<h3>), use three number signs (e.g., ### My Header).
- To bold text, add two asterisks before and after a word or phrase.
- To italicize text, add one asterisk before and after a word or phrase.


#### Guidelines:
1. Preserve All Paragraphs with Conditional Line Omission
-Foreach question in original_question_set, identify the matching question in question_response map and the corresponding block(s) in response_reference.
- For multi-paragraph content in the response_reference, ensure that **all paragraphs are preserved in the final response.**
- Replace the content in each paragraph with the corresponding data from the question_ response_map, but do not delete or omit entire paragraphs
- **Critical Rule**: If a line in the response_reference contains a number of detail that is **not found in the question_response_map**, omit
**only that specific line or phrase** sensibly while keeping the rest of the paragraph intact. For example, if there is no context present about PPA effects or integration-related expenses in question_response_map then omit only that phrase or line from the output
- **Ensure that no necessary information or sections are omitted** and the final response **follows the style and structure of the response_reference.**
- Do **not** invent or assume any numbers or details. If data is missing, simply remove that part without introducing placeholders or hypothetical values.
- Maintain the original tone, formatting, and paragraph structure of the response_reference for consistency.

2. **Strictly Follow the Reference Structure**:
- The final response must match the structure, headings, and paragraph count of the response_reference. Do not add, remove, or reorder any headings or paragraphs.
- The content under each block or section should be of the same volume/length as the related block/section in the response_reference, but replace the content with the latest available data from the question response map.

3. **Summarization Does Not Mean Omission**:
- When summarizing, **do not omit any paragraphs or sections**. Instead, rewrite the content in a concise manner while preserving the meaning and structure of the original text.
- If the 'response_reference contains multiple paragraphs under a heading, ensure that the final response also contains the same number of paragraphs.

4. **Handle Missing Data Gracefully**:
- If the data to answer a given question in original_question_set is not available in the question_response map, then simply **remove that part sensibly by omitting that phrase and do not introduce placeholders or hypothetical values.** 

5. *Number Handling*:
- Preserve the **original unit and scale** of numbers as provided in the question response_map. If input values are in *millions, they must remain in **millions** (no conversion to billions, crores, lakhs, etc.). Do not round, abbreviate, or alter the numeric representation.
**DO NOT EDIT ANY NUMBERS found from question_response_map**

6. **Synonym Mapping for Financial Terms**:
- Recognize synonyms and equivalents. For example: *NPBT, **PBT, **Profit Before Tax, or entries from the **Balance Sheet/Financial Statement* all represent the same metric.

7. *Validation*:
- After generating the final response, validate that the structure, headings, and number of paragraphs match the response_reference. If any discrepancies are found, revise the response to ensure alignment.

#### Example:
response reference:
Block Number: 1:
Text: Global Banking
Block Number: 2:
Text: para 1
Block Number: 3:
Text: para 2
Block Number: 4:
Text: para 3

Final response:
### Global Banking
para 1 (updated content from question_response_map)
para 2 (updated content from question_response_map)
para 3 (updated content from question_response_map)
#### Inputs:

original_question_set:
{original_question_set}

question_response_map:
{question_response_map}

response_reference:
{response_reference}

*IMPORTANT* RECHECK:

- Make sure you haven't converted any numbers or invented any numbers, for instance make sure you haven't converted millions to billions
- If number or its context (where it is coming from) is not present then you should not have the related text (YOU DO NOT INVENT THE PHRASE YOU OMIT IT)
- There is a compulsion for you to do: If the heading is templated as 'Results: 2Q24 vs 2Q23' and the questions and answers are about Q4 of 2024 and 2025 then you should be smart enough to change the heading to 'Results: 4Q25 vs 4Q24'.


*NO HALLUCINATION AND NO INVENTION OF NUMBERS (NUMBERS ARE VERY CRUCIAL)*
