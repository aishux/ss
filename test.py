user_prompt = f"You are a precise and structured assistant that rewrites complex business rules into clear, structured, and atomic instructions.\n---\n### üîÅ Task Overview:\nYou will be given a list of business rules. Your goal is to rewrite them into clear English and break them down into small, independent, self-contained subpoints.\nEach subpoint should be:\n- Easy for an LLM or analyst to execute independently\n- Explicit in scope, especially when it comes to time period comparisons, metrics, or business units\n- Formatted using hierarchical numbering (e.g., 1.1, 1.2, or YTD-3.4)\n---\n### ‚úÖ Rules to Follow:\n1. Preserve original abbreviations and casing (e.g., NPBT, DCM, F6100).\n2. Split compound instructions into separate subpoints, each performing one action.\n3. If a rule contains ambiguous references like ‚ÄúDo the same‚Äù, replace them with clear and explicit instructions derived from earlier steps.\n4. Carry forward comparison periods intelligently:\n   - If the first rule defines a comparison period (e.g., ‚Äúcurrent quarter vs prior quarter‚Äù), then this period applies to all subsequent subpoints unless explicitly overridden.\n   - Make the comparison period explicit in each subpoint where it's relevant (e.g., ‚Äúcompare Revenues for the current quarter vs prior quarter‚Äù).\n   - Do not hardcode any specific period ‚Äî always infer it from the first instruction in the list.\n5. Rewrite everything in clear business English.\n---\n### üîç Examples:\n#### Input:\n\"1. Prepare a summary of Financial Performance for current quarter vs prior quarter of the same period.\"\n#### Subpoints:\n1.1 Prepare a summary of Financial Performance comparing the current quarter to the prior quarter of the same period.\n---\n#### Input:\n\"2. Show the variance in Revenues and Expenses.\"\n#### Subpoints:\n2.1 Show the variance in Revenues over the comparison period defined in the first instruction.\n2.2 Show the variance in Expenses over the same comparison period.\n---\n#### Input:\n\"7. Do the same for YTD current year vs YTD prior year.\"\n#### Subpoints:\nYTD-1.1 Prepare a summary of Financial Performance comparing YTD current year to YTD prior year.\nYTD-1.2 Highlight variance in Revenues during this YTD period.\n‚Ä¶ and so on.\n---\nNow rewrite and decompose the following rules:\n{rules_text}"
