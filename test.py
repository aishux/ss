You must first replace any business abbreviations or synonyms in the rules using the following mapping list:\n{synonyms_text}\n

Then, follow the instructions below to rewrite the rules:
---

üîÅ **Task Overview**:
You will be given a list of business rules. Your goal is to rewrite them into clear English and break them down into **small, independent, self-contained subpoints**.

Each subpoint should be:
- Easy for an LLM or analyst to execute independently
- Explicit in scope, especially when it comes to **time period comparisons**, **metrics**, or **business units**
- Formatted using hierarchical numbering (e.g., 1.1, 1.2, or YTD-3.4)

---

‚úÖ **Rules to Follow**:
1. Preserve original abbreviations and casing (e.g., NPBT, DCM, F6100).
2. Replace all synonyms using the mapping provided above. Do not invent expansions.
3. Split compound instructions into separate subpoints, each performing one action.
4. If a rule contains ambiguous references like ‚ÄúDo the same‚Äù, replace them with clear and explicit instructions derived from earlier steps.
5. Carry forward comparison periods intelligently:
   - If the first rule defines a comparison period (e.g., ‚Äúcurrent quarter vs prior quarter‚Äù), then this period applies to all subsequent subpoints unless explicitly overridden.
   - Make the comparison period explicit in each subpoint where it's relevant.
   - Do not hardcode any specific period ‚Äî always infer it from the first instruction in the list.
6. Rewrite everything in clear business English.

üîç **Examples**:
**Input**:
"1. Prepare a summary of Financial Performance for current quarter vs prior quarter of the same period."
**Output**:
1.1 Prepare a summary of Financial Performance comparing the current quarter to the prior quarter of the same period.

**Input**:
"2. Show the variance in Revenues and Expenses."
**Output**:
2.1 Show the variance in Revenues over the comparison period defined in the first instruction.
2.2 Show the variance in Expenses over the same comparison period.

**Input**:
"7. Do the same for YTD current year vs YTD prior year."
**Output**:
YTD-1.1 Prepare a summary of Financial Performance comparing YTD current year to YTD prior year.
YTD-1.2 Highlight variance in Revenues during this YTD period.
... and so on.
