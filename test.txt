"prompt": "Your task is to generate a final response STRICTLY following the provided Template or Reference document.\n\n#### Inputs: You would be provided with the following inputs:\n1. original_question_set: A set of multiple user questions.\n\n2. question_response_map: This dataset will have the following structure. The key is the multi-part user question, and the value is a set of decomposed questions/sub-questions and their related responses.\n{{\n 'multi-part question1':\n 'sub_question1:...,\n AI_response:...,\n\n 'multi-part question2:\n 'sub_question2:...,\n AI_response:..., \n}}\n\n3. response_reference: This reference object contains sample reference data along with block number, font, size, and color for each line/text extracted from the user-provided reference document.\n\n#### Output:\nThe final response must STRICTLY follow and match the response_reference in terms of:\n- writing style\n- Section structure\n- Language\n- Content/text\n- Paragraph count and order\n- Formatting (e.q., bold, italic, headings, line breaks, etc.)\nThe final output will be displayed on a Web UI. Use appropriate **HTML MARKDOWN tags** for formatting.\n\n#### Guidelines:\n1. **Content Replacement & Strict Omission**\n- For each question in original_question_set, identify the matching question in question_response_map.\n- **Treat the text in response_reference as DUMMY/PLACEHOLDER text.** You must replace it with facts from question_response_map.\n- **Critical Rule**: If a specific detail, reason, or metric (e.g., 'PPA effects', 'integration expenses') exists in the response_reference but is **NOT found in the question_response_map**, you must **DELETE that specific phrase or sentence entirely**. Do not copy-paste the reference text if the data is missing.\n- For multi-paragraph content, ensure the **paragraph count** remains the same, but the content inside is fully updated or shortened based on available data.\n- Do **not** invent or assume any numbers or details. If data is missing, simply remove that part without introducing placeholders.\n\n2. **Strict Structure with Dynamic Headings**:\n- The final response must match the structure and paragraph count of the response_reference.\n- **Heading Exception**: If a heading in response_reference contains a Date or Quarter (e.g., 'Results: 2Q24 vs 2Q23') but the question_response_map contains data for a different period (e.g., '4Q25 vs 4Q24'), **you must UPDATE the heading dates** to match the map data. Do not change the text of the heading, only the numbers representing the date/quarter.\n\n3. **Summarization Does Not Mean Omission**:\n- When summarizing, **do not omit any paragraphs**. Instead, rewrite the content in a concise manner while preserving the meaning.\n\n4. **Handle Missing Data Gracefully**:\n- If the data to answer a given question is not available, simply **remove that part sensibly**.\n\n5. **Strict Number Handling (NO CONVERSIONS)**:\n- **Treat all numbers as immutable strings/text.**\n- Extract numbers EXACTLY as they appear in question_response_map. If the map says '1,200 million', you write '1,200 million'. **DO NOT convert to billions.**\n- **DO NOT round, abbreviate, or alter any numeric representation.**\n\n6. **Synonym Mapping for Financial Terms**:\n- Recognize synonyms (e.g., NPBT = Profit Before Tax).\n\n7. **Validation**:\n- Validate
