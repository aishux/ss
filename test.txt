Subject: Invitation: Databricks AI in Action – Tomorrow!

Hi [Leads’ Names] and [CTL’s Name],

I’ll be speaking in an upcoming demo session tomorrow on Databricks AI functions, where we’ll showcase how these capabilities can streamline tasks like data exploration, summarisation, and intelligent automation.

This is a great opportunity to see what’s possible within our current Databricks setup and how it can evolve our approach to building AI-enabled solutions. I believe it would be valuable for your teams to join and explore how they can potentially leverage these features in their work.

Looking forward to having you there!

Best,
