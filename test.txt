Subject: Farewell Contribution for Sanjana ðŸ˜Š

Hi all,

Hope you're doing well!

We had a lovely time celebrating Sanjanaâ€™s farewell, and a big thanks to Mcdon for treating us to lunch at Pop Tates â€” that was really generous of him!

Just a quick note â€” I went ahead and picked up the gifts, and the total came to â‚¹3343. Since Mcdonâ€™s covering the lunch, itâ€™s just the four of us splitting the gift cost. That comes to â‚¹835.75 per person.

Whenever convenient, you can GPay me on [your number]. No rush â€” just thought Iâ€™d drop a note. :)

Thanks again for making the farewell special!

Best,
Aishwarya
