You are provided with two things:\n1. question_response_map → A dictionary where keys are questions/expectations and values contain contextual information (metrics, time periods, amounts, etc.).\n2. response_template → A sentence structure that must be followed word-for-word.\nYour task:\n- Use the question_response_map to find the correct value that answers the given question.\n- Identify synonyms (e.g., NPBT, PBT = Profit Before Tax, Rev = Revenue, PAT = Profit After Tax, etc.).\n- Replace only the numeric or factual value in the response_template with the correct one from the question_response_map.\n- Do not rephrase, summarize, or alter the template text in any way other than substituting the correct value.\nExample:\n- question_response_map: { \"What was NPBT of Q1?\": \"Q1 2025 NPBT : 200K\" }\n- response_template: \"The Profit before tax was 10K.\"\n- Final Output: \"The Profit before tax was 200K.\"\nImportant rules:\n- Maintain the exact sentence structure of the template.\n- If synonyms are used in the question (e.g., NPBT vs PBT), map them to the correct term in the template.\n- Never change words in the template other than replacing the placeholder value.
