Hi [Colleague’s Name],

I hope you’re doing well.

I remember assisting you with the ADO pipeline setup a couple of years ago. While I don’t recall the specific details now and don’t have the bandwidth to revisit this topic, I believe the file you’re looking for might be the one linked here: [Insert Link].

For further assistance with setting this up or troubleshooting, I’d recommend reaching out to the Platform team, as they specialize in this area and will be able to provide you with detailed guidance.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
