Hi Sergio,

I hope you're doing well. I fully acknowledge the mistake on my part and appreciate that it was brought to light so it could be addressed quickly.

However, I feel that this situation could have been resolved between us directly without involving Mcdon or Karthik, as there was no impact on our Kyvos products, and the issue was quickly fixed. I believe open communication and collaboration can help us manage such scenarios more efficiently in the future.

I also recall assisting you with a similar issue in the past, where we worked together to resolve it. I value the same approach and believe it fosters a stronger sense of teamwork.

Let me know your thoughts, and Iâ€™m happy to discuss this further if needed.

Best regards,
