Subject: Walkthrough of GTMIS, WARP, and LiFe Team Roles

Hi All,

As discussed with King, I’ll be walking through my understanding of the GTMIS, WARP, and LiFe teams, along with a more detailed view of Brian’s architectural diagram that I put together. The idea is to validate the understanding and clarify the division of responsibilities (e.g., Capital calculators vs. Liquidity).
