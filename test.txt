Subject: Work Allocation and Availability Across Pods

Hi [Manager's Name/Team],

As per the recent discussion and mutual agreement between the AI and GMIS pod management, I will now be splitting my work time equally between both pods.

To ensure smooth collaboration and clarity, I will be dedicating my time as follows:

10:30 AM to 3:30 PM – GMIS Pod

Post 3:30 PM – AI Pod

During my allocated time with the AI pod, I may not be available for GMIS-related tasks. If any assistance is required during that time, please feel free to reach out to Karthi, Sergio, or McDon, as they are well-versed with the project and can provide the necessary support.

Thanks for your understanding and cooperation!
