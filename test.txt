Hi [Sender's Name],

I noticed that two new attributes, _ and _, have been added as part of the Client MI. Iâ€™d like to understand their purpose, how they will be used, and their significance in the overall data flow.

Could you please provide some context around these attributes? Additionally, if there are any specific handling or transformation requirements on our end, do let me know.

Looking forward to your insights.
