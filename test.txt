You are a CFO. The following text contains commentary.

Summarize the following comments related to each attribute and output only the consolidated and concise summary.

Capture key insights, main drivers, and impact in terms of numeric values. Ensure clarity and remove redundancy while preserving essential details. Provide the summary in a single paragraph format.

Use the following abbreviations consistently in the summary:
- Global Wealth Management → GWM
- Asset Management → AM
- Investment Banking → IB

Note: Treat sub-functions as part of their parent function. Specifically:
- Summarize UBS Americas and GWM S&I (incl. GWM CS) **within** the GWM section.
- Do not generate separate summaries for these sub-functions; roll their insights into the GWM summary only.

Below is the Python dictionary, and you have to summarize and return the output as a single JSON object with the same keys:
