Below are the specific changes we would like to request:

- **[Current Aspect 1]**: [Brief explanation of what it is now]  
  **Proposed Change**: [Brief explanation of what you want to change it to].

- **[Current Aspect 2]**: [Brief explanation of what it is now]  
  **Proposed Change**: [Brief explanation of what you want to change it to].

- **[Current Aspect 3]**: [Brief explanation of what it is now]

We understand that changes at this stage might be challenging, but we believe that this adjustment will allow us to deliver a more impactful and innovative solution. Our revised idea is more refined and directly addresses a critical issue, which we believe will add significant value to the hackathon.

We kindly request your permission to update our project details. We assure you that this change will not affect the timelines, and we are fully committed to adhering to all other guidelines.
