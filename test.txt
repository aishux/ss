Hi Radek and Priti,

I’ve summarized the comments from the data sent by Radek and added them under the ai_comment column in the aggregated_comments tab.

I’ve also included the prompt used for the summarization. Please note that the examples in the prompt remain unchanged, but based on my understanding, the AI has still done a decent job of generating relevant summaries.

Let me know your thoughts or if any changes are needed.

Best regards,
Aishwarya
