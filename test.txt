Hi Satya,

The MD&A rules decomposition and rephrasing is now complete. I’ve attached an Excel file containing the input rules, the rephrased output, and the prompt used for the process.

The code has been checked into the commentary_framework branch.

Please feel free to review it whenever you get the time. I’ve also scheduled a call on Monday to walk you through the details.

Best regards,
Aishwarya
