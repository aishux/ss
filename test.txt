Subject: Urgent: Medical Emergency / Critical Update regarding Friday Release - [Your Name]

To: Abhishek, Mark Cc: [Any other relevant leads]

Hi Abhishek, Hi Mark,

I am writing to inform you that I have had an accident while jogging this morning and unfortunately cannot log in today.

I took a bad fall against an iron barricade (likely due to exhaustion/dizziness) and have significantly injured my right leg and right arm. I am currently in severe pain and the doctor has strictly advised complete bed rest. Since I have injured my working arm, I am unable to use the computer at the moment.

Regarding the AI Release: I am fully aware that our release is scheduled for this Friday and that I am the primary resource on this. I am deeply concerned about the timeline. However, given my current physical state, I am unable to work today. I will reassess my pain levels tomorrow morning and keep you posted on whether I can resume work or if we need to discuss a contingency plan for the release.

As advised by you, Abhi, I will upload the medical certificate to the HRI portal as soon as I am capable of doing so.

I sincerely apologize for this disruption at such a critical time.

Regards,

[Your Name]
