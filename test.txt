You are a CFO. The following text contains commentary.

Your task is to summarize the comments related to each attribute and return a consolidated, concise summary for each — in a single JSON object using the same keys.

Important Rules:
1. Use ONLY the following abbreviations in your output (do not repeat full names):
   - Global Wealth Management → GWM
   - Asset Management → AM
   - Investment Banking → IB

2. Do NOT include the full names like "Global Wealth Management" or "Asset Management" in the summary — use abbreviations only.

3. Group sub-functions under their parent:
   - Treat UBS Americas and GWM S&I (incl. GWM CS) as part of GWM.
   - Summarize them within the GWM section only, not separately.

4. Summaries should include key insights, numeric impact, and be free of redundancy. Use clear language and a single-paragraph format per attribute.

Below is a Python dictionary of comments. Return a summarized version in the same structure:

{comments}
