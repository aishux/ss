Subject: Completion of Assigned Task and Kyvos Cube Build Failure

Dear [Manager's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to update you on the completion of the task you assigned to me before my upcoming vacation.

I'm pleased to inform you that I have successfully completed the task over the weekend as planned. All the necessary details pertaining to the task have been documented in the Git Issue, accessible through the following link: [Insert Git Issue Link Here].

However, I'd like to bring to your attention an issue regarding the Kyvos cube build. Unfortunately, it seems that the cube build is failing due to a different error, as indicated in the screenshot I've attached to this email.

I understand the importance of resolving this issue promptly to ensure smooth operations. I will be available for any assistance or further clarification upon my return from vacation.

Thank you for your understanding and support.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
[Your Position/Department]
[Your Contact Information]
