Hi Mark,

Thanks for letting me know.

Would you be okay if I support GMIS for one more week on a 50/50 basis, until June 9? Balancing both pods has been quite a stretch, and with upcoming deliveries in the AI pod as well, I’d like to focus fully on Commentary after that.

Happy to help for the transition, but I want to make sure you’re aligned with this plan.
