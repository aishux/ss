You will be provided with:
1. A dictionary named `question_response_map` ‚Äî containing user expectations (questions) as keys, and context/information as values.
2. A `response_template` that you MUST STRICTLY follow in terms of structure, wording, style, and headings.

üîπ Your task:
- For each question in `question_response_map`, extract the appropriate data from its corresponding value.
- Then:
  a. Summarise the value **in the style and format of the provided `response_template`**.
  b. If the `response_template` contains placeholders like `<given amount>` or `<given month and year>`, REPLACE them using the information in the map value.
  c. Do NOT change or rephrase any static text from the template.
  d. If multiple templates are possible, identify the correct one based on format and follow its **exact wording**.
- Finally, output the responses with their associated headings exactly as shown in the template.

‚ö†Ô∏è Very Important:
- The wording, structure, headings, and sentence flow must remain **constant** and **unchanged** from the template.
- If the template contains dummy values, replace them with real values from the context, but **do not rephrase** anything else.
- If a particular detail is missing from context, retain the placeholder (e.g., `<given amount>`).

Input:
question_response_map: {question_response_map}

response_template: {response_template}


You would be provided with a map/dictionary, question_response_map, having question or user expectation as key and context or gathered information as value.\nYour task is to summarise the context against each question and create a short heading for each question.\nIf response_template is available, STRICTLY follow only the formatting and writing style available in template.\nFill the template with relevant amounts and replace any dummy amounts such as <given amount> or details such as <given month and year> with amounts and dates mentioned in value of map/dictionary and return the altered response.\nStrictly follow the writing style and dont change any static words.\nquestion_response_map:{question_response_map}\n\nresponse_template:{response_template}
