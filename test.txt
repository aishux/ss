Subject: Exploring Databricks AI Functions for Comment Summarization & Minor Insight Detection

Hi King and Mark,

I wanted to share a recent discovery around Databricks AI Functions, specifically ai_query, which looks promising for our use case.

Initial tests show that ai_query is capable of summarizing comments effectivelyâ€”essentially doing the job of our current Summation Agent. Additionally, it can assist with minor insight detection before the data is pulled into the Talk2FRS webapp via JDBC.

Iâ€™ve discussed this with Satya, and we both think itâ€™s worth deeper exploration.

You can refer to the official documentation and a helpful demo notebook below:

While we continue our analysis, I just wanted to check if you're aware of any restrictions or limitations around using Databricks AI Functionsâ€”especially in production environments or from a security/compliance standpoint.

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best regards,
Aishwarya
