Subject: Filename Change in Production â€“ GPCCLI-D-GEN-DIM to GPCCLI-D-GEN_DIM

Hi Alicia,

As discussed on the call, we request the filename change in production from GPCCLI-D-GEN-DIM to GPCCLI-D-GEN_DIM, as the hyphen was causing issues on our end.

We have already made this change in SIT, and it is scheduled to be released to PROD on Friday. Please let us know once the update is implemented on your side or if any further details are needed.

Thanks,
[Your Name]
