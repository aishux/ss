Dear [Recipient's Name],

I hope this message finds you well.

Please accept my apologies for the delayed response. Attached, you will find the Python installation guide that can be shared with the participants.

Additionally, I am proposing to conduct the training sessions between the 21st and 25th of October. To cover the basics thoroughly, I suggest three sessions of 2 hours each. Should it be necessary to include the Python installation process during the training, we can allocate an additional 30-minute session for that as well.

Please let me know if this schedule works or if any adjustments are required.

Looking forward to your feedback.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
