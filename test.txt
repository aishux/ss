Subject: Urgent: Sick Leave - [Your Name]

Hi Abhishek,

I am writing to let you know that I unfortunately won’t be able to log in today.

I had an accident while jogging this morning. I was feeling quite nauseous and dizzy (likely due to exhaustion from working late last night) and took a bad fall against an iron barricade. I’ve significantly injured my right leg and right arm.

I am currently in severe pain and have very limited mobility, so the doctor has strictly advised complete bed rest for now.

As advised by you, Abhi, I will upload the medical certificate to the HRI portal as soon as I am physically able to manage it.

Sincere apologies for the inconvenience.

Regards,
