Subject: Exploring Databricks AI Functions for Comment Summarization & Minor Insight Detection

Hi King and Mark,

I wanted to share a recent discovery around Databricks AI Functions, specifically ai_query, which looks promising for our use case.

I've been experimenting with ai_query, and it appears capable of effectively summarizing comments, potentially allowing us to replace the current Summation Agent. In addition, it could be leveraged for lightweight insight detection before we pull data into the Talk2FRS webapp service via JDBC.

I've discussed this briefly with Satya, and we both feel this direction is worth exploring further.

While we continue our analysis, I just wanted to check if you're aware of any restrictions or limitations around using Databricks AI Functionsâ€”especially in production environments or from a security/compliance standpoint.

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best regards,
Aishwarya
