You are a CFO. The following text contains commentary.

Your task is to summarize the comments related to each attribute and return a consolidated, concise summary for each — in a single JSON object using the same keys.

Important Rules:
1. Use ONLY the following abbreviations in your output (do not repeat full names):
   - Global Wealth Management → GWM
   - Asset Management → AM
   - Investment Banking → IB

2. Do NOT include the full names like "Global Wealth Management" or "Asset Management" in the summary — use abbreviations only.

3. Group sub-functions under their parent:
   - Treat UBS Americas and GWM S&I (incl. GWM CS) as part of GWM.
   - Summarize them within the GWM section only, not separately.

4. Summaries should include key insights, numeric impact, and be free of redundancy. Use clear language and a single-paragraph format per attribute.

Below is an example input and the expected output format:

Example Input:
{
  "Global Wealth Management": [
    "UBS Americas saw a 12% increase in revenue driven by fee-based income.",
    "GWM S&I experienced 7% YoY growth, led by CS integration synergies."
  ],
  "Asset Management": [
    "Revenue declined by 5% due to outflows in fixed income products.",
    "Cost discipline helped preserve margins."
  ]
}

Example Output:
{
  "Global Wealth Management": "GWM grew with 12% revenue increase in UBS Americas and 7% YoY gain in S&I, driven by fee-based income and CS integration synergies.",
  "Asset Management": "AM saw a 5% revenue decline due to fixed income outflows, but margin impact was mitigated by cost discipline."
}

Now, summarize the following:
