"prompt": "Your task is to generate a financial/data report by merging two inputs. You must use the **structure** of the response_reference but the **facts and numbers** from the question_response_map.\n\n#### The Golden Rules (Read Carefully):\n1. **Source of Truth**: The question_response_map is the ONLY source of facts, numbers, dates, and reasoning.\n2. **Source of Structure**: The response_reference is a **TEMPLATE ONLY**. It contains **outdated/dummy text**. Never copy facts, numbers, or specific reasons (e.g., 'due to PPA effects') from the reference if they are not confirmed in the map.\n3. **No Math/Conversions**: Treat numbers as strings of text. If the map says '500 million', you write '500 million'. Do **NOT** convert to '0.5 billion'. Do **NOT** calculate differences unless explicitly stated in the map.\n\n----\n\n#### Inputs:\n1. original_question_set: User questions.\n2. question_response_map: The dataset containing the answers (The Source of Truth).\n3. response_reference: The styling and structure template (The Skeleton).\n\n#### Step-by-Step Execution Plan:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Headings & Context**\n- Look at the headings in response_reference.\n- **Dynamic Update**: If the reference heading mentions a date/quarter (e.g., '2Q24 vs 2Q23') but your question_response_map contains data for a different period (e.g., '4Q25 vs 4Q24'), **YOU MUST UPDATE THE HEADING** to reflect the data in the map.\n- Do not change the *type* of heading (e.g., 'Results', 'Outlook'), only the time variables.\n\n**Step 2: Paragraph Reconstruction (The Merger)**\n- Iterate through each block in the response_reference.\n- **Goal**: Rewrite the paragraph to match the reference's *tone* and *length*, but replace 100% of the information with data from question_response_map.\n- **Missing Data Handling (Surgical Omission)**:\n - If the Reference says: 'Revenue grew due to PPA effects and organic growth.'\n - And the Map says: 'Revenue grew.' (No mention of PPA).\n - **Output**: 'Revenue grew.' (You must DELETE the phrase 'due to PPA effects' because it is not in the source of truth).\n - **Do not copy-paste the Reference text if the data is missing**. It is better to have a shorter sentence than a hallucinated one.\n\n**Step 3: Number Verification**\n- Extract numbers **VERBATIM** from the question_response_map.\n- **Strict Ban**: Do not round up, do not convert units, do not change 'Mn' to 'Millions' or vice versa. Copy exactly what is provided.\n- If a specific metric (e.g., 'Operating Margin') is in the Reference but completely missing from the Map, **remove that specific sentence entirely.**\n\n----\n\n#### Output Guidelines:\n1. **HTML Formatting**: Use Markdown/HTML tags strictly as requested (### for headings, ** for bold).\n2. **Paragraph Structure**: Maintain the paragraph count of the reference. If the reference has 3 paragraphs, try to generate 3 paragraphs, unless the question_response_map has absolutely zero data for a section, in which case omit that section sensibly.\n3. **Tone**: Professional, financial, and concise.\n\n#### Data Processing Examples (Few-Shot Training):\n\n* **Example 1 (Dynamic Headings)**:\n - *Reference Heading*: '2Q23 Highlights'\n - *Map Data*: contains data for '4Q25'\n - *Final Output*: ### 4Q25 Highlights\n\n* **Example 2 (Surgical Omission)**:\n - *Reference Text*: 'Expenses increased by $5M driven by higher integration costs.'\n - *Map Data*: 'Expenses increased by $5M.' (No mention of integration costs).\n - *Final Output*: 'Expenses increased by $5M.' (Reasoning omitted).\n\n* **Example 3 (Number Integrity)**:\n - *Map Data*: '1,200 million'\n - *Bad Output*: '1.2 billion' (Wrong - Conversion detected)\n - *Good Output*: '1,200 million' (Correct - Verbatim)\n\n----\n\n#### Begin Generation:\n\n**original_question_set**:\n{original_question_set}\n\n**question_response_map**:\n{question_response_map}\n\n**response_reference**:\n{response_reference}"
