Hi Radek and Priti,

I’ve attached the summarised comments as discussed.

The example provided was quite helpful in guiding the structure and tone, and it contributed to framing the comments more effectively. If there’s a need to improve the quality of any specific section in the future, we can include short, targeted examples to help fine-tune the outputs further.

Let me know if you have any feedback.

Best regards,
Aishwarya
