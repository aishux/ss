Hi [CTL’s Name],

Due to heavy rains, the network and power have been fluctuating, and I may not be able to join smoothly today. I’m moving our 1:1 to Wednesday — please let me know if you’d like to reschedule to another time that works better for you.

Apologies for the short notice, and thanks for your understanding.

Best regards,
Aishwarya
