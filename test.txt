**Project Title: Internal Mobility Web Portal**

**Description:**  
Our project aims to streamline the internal mobility process within the organization by developing a web portal that connects employees with hiring managers. Instead of employees solely applying for job IDs, the portal allows them to create detailed profiles showcasing their skills, experience, and career interests. Hiring managers can then proactively search for and reach out to suitable candidates based on their requirements, fostering a more dynamic and efficient internal hiring process. This approach empowers employees by increasing visibility of their potential and enables hiring managers to find the right talent faster.
