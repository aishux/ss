Subject: Commentary Agent – Preview of My Work

Hi Mark,

I had prepared for the Show and Tell session today, but unfortunately, it got cancelled due to the test fire drill in the London office. Since I had completed my part, I wanted to share a quick overview of the work I was planning to present.

Please find attached a PDF preview of the Commentary Agent.

On Page 1, you’ll see the Rules Interpretation output. These are the initial inputs provided by the user (Querish), which the Rules Agent processes by rephrasing, decomposing, and grouping into:

Query-type rules (which require data extraction)

Summary-type rules (which involve descriptive insights)

The Query-type rules are passed to the IB Data Agent, which generates corresponding SQL queries. You can find the decomposed questions and their generated queries on Pages 2 and 3.

The results from the IB Data Agent are then passed to the Summarisation and Commentary Agent, which produces a basic commentary.

The commentary output is still in a preliminary stage — we’re currently not following a structured template, and improvements are needed in terms of:

Commentary quality

Dynamic orchestration

Overall performance tuning

I’d be happy to walk you through it on Monday. Also, many thanks to Satya for his help with the query and results part.

Thanks,
Aishwarya
