This year, my significant contributions and achievements can be summarized as follows:

1. **Enhanced GMIS-Transition Security Module:** I took ownership of the GMIS-Transition Security module, improving the BBS Security script, avoiding redundant user and data security rule creation in Kyvos, and implementing dynamic KPI Calculated Members for Kyvos cubes. Additionally, I established TEST and DEV environments for security testing and added logging functionality.

2. **Facilitated FRS Data Exposure:** I assisted the IB pod in exposing FRS Data to AQUA Stream by applying ACLs in lower environments and creating an Azure ADO Pipeline to dynamically and recursively provide access from our PROD storage account.

3. **Processed GWM Monthly Data for PNC Cube:** I processed GWM Monthly data for the PNC cube in Kyvos, ensuring standardization, KPI computation, and trend analysis. I also incorporated security measures to grant access exclusively to VW3 users.

4. **Managed PSR Data Processing:** I sourced PSR data from GWM and applied various transformations, including Filter File logic.

5. **Target Manual Data Loads and Processing:** I was responsible for creating target manual feeds for the APP UI, processing data through all layers, and applying transformations and trend logic.

6. **Technical Implementations:** I implemented a Fortify Scan in our Gitlab, updated APP UI and Security with the latest Postgres Flex details, and established a connection for Kyvos Cubes to operate on the new GMIS KYVOS cluster.

7. **Professional Certifications and Recognition:** I achieved several badges, including the Gold Certified Engineer badge, StackOverflow Star badge, and Engineering Blogger badge for writing technical blogs featured in UBS newsletters. I also completed the Power BI: PL 300 certification.

8. **Contributions to Certi-Fridays Initiative:** As part of #IndiaTomorrow led by Saj Sekhon, I actively contributed to the Certi-Fridays initiative. I played a role in executing the initiative, acted as a mentor and trainer for AZ-900 and PL-300 certification sessions, and wrote a blog to promote the success of the event.

9. **Trainer for Code Red India:** I trained over 150 women in India in Python, provided support to address their queries, and assisted with their projects.

10. **Speaker for APAC Certified Engineer:** I delivered a session on the significance of Cultural Badges and offered tips and tricks for earning them. This session was attended by more than 1000 individuals from the APAC region.

11. **UBS-CS Conference Day Events:** I conducted events for UBS-CS Conference Day as part of the Women in Technology (WIT) initiative led by Sheeba Nadar.

The impact of these achievements has been substantial. They have contributed to the improvement of security measures, data processing efficiency, and professional development within the organization. Additionally, my active participation in certification programs and community initiatives has not only enhanced my own skills but also positively influenced the professional growth and knowledge-sharing in the broader community.
